One day, I played a bit with Unity.
I didn't really like it, but I was really interrested by the way of using behaviour on entitys.
This is an test on implementing a entity / component system.
Later I discovered Entity / System with ash.
This unfinished game was a submission for #1gam.
Assets are not from me but Patrice Maillot.
